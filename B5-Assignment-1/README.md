## Blog Post 1: Understanding `any`, `unknown`, and `never` Types in TypeScript

TypeScript's type system includes several special types that serve unique purposes. In this blog post, we'll explore the differences between `any`, `unknown`, and `never` types.

### The `any` Type: The Double-Edged Sword

The `any` type is TypeScript's most flexible type, but it comes with risks. It essentially turns off type checking:

```typescript
let anyValue: any = 10;
anyValue = "hello";     // OK
anyValue = true;        // OK
anyValue.someMethod();  // OK (but dangerous!)
anyValue.nonexistentMethod();  // No TypeScript error!
```

While `any` provides maximum flexibility, it sacrifices TypeScript's type safety benefits. Think of it as an escape hatch that should be used sparingly.

### The `unknown` Type: Type-Safe Alternative

`unknown` is the type-safe counterpart of `any`. It's more restrictive and safer:

```typescript
let unknownValue: unknown = 10;
unknownValue = "hello";  // OK
unknownValue = true;     // OK

// These will cause TypeScript errors:
unknownValue.toFixed();  // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'
unknownValue.length;     // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'

// Proper way to use unknown:
if (typeof unknownValue === "number") {
    unknownValue.toFixed();  // OK - TypeScript knows it's a number
}
```

The key difference is that `unknown` requires type checking before performing operations, making it much safer than `any`.

### The `never` Type: The Impossible Type

The `never` type represents values that never occur. It's used in two main scenarios:

1. Functions that never return:
```typescript
function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
}

function infiniteLoop(): never {
    while (true) {}
}
```

2. Impossible type intersections:
```typescript
type Impossible = string & number; // Type is 'never'
```

### When to Use Each Type

- Use `any` when: You're migrating JavaScript code to TypeScript and need a temporary solution
- Use `unknown` when: You don't know the type of a value but want to maintain type safety
- Use `never` when: You need to represent impossible states or functions that never return

## Blog Post 2: Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript's type system allows us to create complex types through unions (`|`) and intersections (`&`). Let's explore how these powerful features work.

### Union Types: The "OR" of Types

Union types allow a value to be one of several types. Think of it as "this OR that":

```typescript
type StringOrNumber = string | number;

function processValue(value: StringOrNumber) {
    if (typeof value === "string") {
        return value.toUpperCase();
    } else {
        return value * 2;
    }
}

console.log(processValue("hello")); // "HELLO"
console.log(processValue(5));       // 10
```

### Intersection Types: The "AND" of Types

Intersection types combine multiple types into one. Think of it as "this AND that":

```typescript
interface Car {
    brand: string;
    model: string;
}

interface Electric {
    batteryLife: number;
    charge(): void;
}

type ElectricCar = Car & Electric;

const tesla: ElectricCar = {
    brand: "Tesla",
    model: "Model 3",
    batteryLife: 300,
    charge() {
        console.log("Charging...");
    }
};
```

### Real-World Applications

#### Union Types in Practice:
```typescript
// API Response States
type ApiResponse<T> = {
    status: "loading";
} | {
    status: "success";
    data: T;
} | {
    status: "error";
    error: Error;
};

// Function Parameters
function printId(id: number | string) {
    if (typeof id === "string") {
        console.log(id.toUpperCase());
    } else {
        console.log(id);
    }
}
```

#### Intersection Types in Practice:
```typescript
// Role-based Permissions
interface BaseUser {
    id: string;
    name: string;
}

interface AdminPermissions {
    createUser: () => void;
    deleteUser: () => void;
}

type AdminUser = BaseUser & AdminPermissions;
```

### Best Practices

1. Union Types:
   - Use for values that can be one of several types
   - Always handle all possible cases
   - Consider using discriminated unions for complex cases

2. Intersection Types:
   - Use for combining interfaces or types
   - Ensure properties don't conflict
   - Consider composition over inheritance

### Conclusion

Union and intersection types are fundamental features in TypeScript that enable:
- More precise type definitions
- Better code organization
- Enhanced type safety
- Flexible API design

Understanding and properly using these types will help you write more maintainable and type-safe TypeScript code.
